## Overview

Using VBA scripting Ive analyzed some generated stock market data. The intention of this is to demonstrate to some capacity the ability to use VBA to functionally work through Excel data.

<li>Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>

<li>The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.</li>
